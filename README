You will need to set up your Apache James server to store users and messages in a database.

To run this, you must have a James database running. I use MySQL. The app uses Hibernate, so you should be able to use other databases as well.
Download the source from github.
Untar/unzip it.
You will need to add database info to src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml
You should be able to run "mvn clean" and get a successful build
You can run "mvn test" and get a successful build. You will see a stack trace in a successful build. One of the tests tries to add a duplicate entry database, and this causes a stack trace.

The URL is http://localhost:8080/JamesAdminWebApp/jsp/adminMainPage.jsf

Right now when I run it in Netbeans it does not work as a Maven project. I had to make a Netbeans web project and copy the files to a Maven project in another directory. So you might have to migrate the project to some IDE to get it to work.
